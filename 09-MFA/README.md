# MFA

[Full Tutorial](https://auth0.com/docs/quickstart/spa/react/09-mfa)

This example shows how to add ***Multifactor Authentication*** to your Auth0 authentication flow in a ReactJS project. To enable MFA in your Auth0 account, go to the [Multifactor Authentication section](https://manage.auth0.com/#/guardian) of the management area and enable either Push Notifications or SMS. There is no need for extra code configuration.

## Getting Started

The library `auth0-lock` provides the user authentication, and we also have `src/utils/AuthService.js` class to wrap Lock Widget usage and manage the localStorage items.

In order to get start, run the three commands below. Make sure your `.env` file has the correct values from your auth0 account.

```bash
# Install the dependencies
npm install

# copy configuration and replace with your own
cp .env.example .env

# Run
npm start
```

The npm start command uses webpack to compile the application code and run a simple server for the development environment. It also keeps watching for file changes, updating the browser tab properly.

Shut it down manually with Ctrl-C.

## Important Snippets

### 1. Login

```javascript
/* ===== ./src/utils/AuthService.js ===== */
import Auth0Lock from 'auth0-lock'

export default class AuthService {
  constructor(clientId, domain) {
    // Configure Auth0
    this.lock = new Auth0Lock(clientId, domain, {})
    // Add callback for lock `authenticated` event
    this.lock.on('authenticated', this._doAuthentication.bind(this))
    // binds login functions to keep this context
    this.login = this.login.bind(this)
  }

  _doAuthentication(authResult){
    // Saves the user token
    this.setToken(authResult.idToken)
  }

  login() {
    // Call the show method to display the widget.
    this.lock.show()
  }

  ...
}
```

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, amont others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).
